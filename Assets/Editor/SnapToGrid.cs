/*
Description

Snaps objects to a grid in 3 dimensions. The grid spacing may be different for each axis.
[edit] Usage

You must place the script in a folder named Editor in your project's Assets folder for it to work properly.

Select some objects in the Scene view or Hierarchy window, then choose GameObjectâ†’Snap to Grid from the menu 
(or press control G). Each selected object will be independently snapped to a unit grid.

If you require a different grid spacing, change gridx, gridy, and gridz below.
